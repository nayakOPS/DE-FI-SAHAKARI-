third web
To install and set up thirdweb for contract deployment and interaction, you can follow these steps:

Install the thirdweb CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal:

npm i -g thirdweb
Navigate to the backend folder in your project directory.

Inside the backend folder, create a new folder for your smart contracts.

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend folder.

Run the following command to create a new project with the thirdweb packages installed and configured:

npx thirdweb create --contract
You will be prompted to provide the framework to build with (Hardhat or Forge), the base contract (ERC721, ERC1155, or ERC20), and the name of your smart contract.

After providing the necessary information, the project will be created with the thirdweb packages installed and configured for contract development.

To compile your smart contracts and detect any extensions you have implemented, run the following command:

npx thirdweb build
The command will detect the framework you're using (Hardhat or Forge) and compile all of your smart contracts using the framework's compiler.

It will also display any extensions you have implemented for each contract.

Now you have successfully installed and set up thirdweb for contract deployment and interaction in your backend folder. You can proceed with deploying and interacting with your smart contracts using thirdweb CLI command
